# Description:
# In this example, "inheriting" base by derived and overriding n should result
# in non terminating mutual recursion, because derived.n will call base.m, which
# will again call derived.n
#
# Desired output:
# The analyzer should output that:
# - derived.n is mutually recursive with base.m, when self is an instance
#   of derived
# - base.m is mutually recursive with derived.n, when self is an instance
#   of derived
