# Description:
# In this example, base defines 2 attributes n and m and derived overrides n
# seemingly resulting in a recursion, but in reality self of derived.n can be
# only obj, because g is called on self and nor base nor derived have such
# method, so only obj can be passed to derived.n safely.
#
# Desired output:
# No recursion is detected
